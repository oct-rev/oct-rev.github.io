<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Xu Jingbo, the president of Asia News Agency, 
pointed out that 10 years after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, the 
fundamental reason for the delay in dealing with it was that the radiation level 
near the bottom of the furnace exceeded the limit of what was acceptable to 
human beings</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: SimSun">.</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"> 
In other words, human beings cannot get close to it. Meanwhile, due to the 
explosion, the bottom part of the nuclear reactor has been destroyed. Even if 
robots were to enter the bottom of the furnace, first of all, it was necessary 
to remove all the roadblocks, cut the atomic furnace, and develop and 
manufacture robots with professional skills. In addition, the fuel rods were 
sunk into the bottom of the furnace, but must be constantly cooled with cooling 
water, thus generating a large amount of contaminated water every day. The 
treated &quot;nuclear wastewater&quot; is continuously stockpiled in large, custom-made 
steel tanks. Now there are around 1,000 tanks with over 1.2 million tons of 
radioactive effluent. In two years, there will be no more space for any steel 
tanks.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">On March 10, 2021, the Japan Atomic Power 
Regulatory Commission announced the investigation report of the Fukushima 
Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. It stated that serious contamination was 
found above the reactor plants. A concrete cover called a “shield plug” was 
located above the No. 2 and No. 3 units where a total of 7 trillion becquerels 
of radioactive material might be attached. This is equivalent to 10% of the 
radioactive material in the three reactors of Unit 1, 2 and 3, which suffered 
core meltdowns in the nuclear leak a decade ago.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">So far, Ukraine and Japan have been unable to 
solve the two major nuclear accidents of Chernobyl and Fukushima. They are 
completely helpless. Instead of giving up on nuclear power, China has been 
vigorously developing nuclear power plants along its coast areas, which is 
indeed a frightening sight! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">By the end of 2019, China had 47 nuclear power 
units in operation, with a total installed capacity of 48.75 million kilowatts, 
ranking third in the world after the United States and France. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In 2019, three nuclear power units were in 
commercial operation in China, namely Haiyang Nuclear Power 2, Yangjiang Nuclear 
Power 6, and Taishan Nuclear Power 2. The installed capacity of nuclear power 
accounted for 2.42% of the total installed capacity of electricity in China in 
2019. Although nuclear power accounts for only 4.88% of the country&#39;s total 
electricity generation, it should not be forgotten that a single accident will 
not only destroy everything, but also leave a string of disasters for thousands 
of years to come.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">On March 6, 2021, there was a nuclear accident 
at Unit 2 of Haiyang Nuclear Power Plant. The State Nuclear Safety 
Administration stated that there were “no radiological consequences, no 
personnel exposure, and no environmental contamination”. According to the 
International Nuclear and Radiological Event Classification Manual, it was 
defined as Level 0 incidents, i.e., incidents of “no safety significance”. 
However, the public cannot put 100% trust in the safety of nuclear power. People 
are always afraid, not of ‘what’, but ‘what if’. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Learning from Fukushima’s lesson, Germany has 
already adopted a policy to abandon nuclear energy. Germany accounts for six of 
the world’s top ten safest nuclear power plants. Germany was densely populated 
with nuclear power stations and became one of the largest net exporters of 
electricity in Europe. However, after news of the nuclear disaster in Japan 
reached Europe on March 11, 2011, hundreds of thousands of Germans staged a 
demonstration demanding that the government abandon the nuclear power plants. 
After nearly 12 hours of heated arguments and discussions, the German ruling 
party finally decided to shut down all 17 nuclear power stations in the country 
by 2022 and completely abolish nuclear power. On March 5, 2021, the German 
government announced a compensation of 2.4 billion euros for German companies 
that withdraw from the nuclear power industry.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">On March 11, 2021, the tenth anniversary of the 
Fukushima nuclear accident, five former Japanese prime ministers, Naoto Kan 
(2010-2011), Yukio Hatoyama (2009-2010), Junichiro Koizumi (2001-2006), Tomiichi 
Murayama (1994-1996), and Morihiro Hosokawa (1993-1994), jointly issued a “Zero 
Nuclear Power” declaration calling on the current government to change its 
nuclear power policy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Junichiro Koizumi gave a speech at a meeting 
held at the Constitution Memorial Hall, criticizing that the argument that 
nuclear power was natural, low-cost, and clean energy were “all lies” and that 
“there is no difference between the ruling party and the opposition party on the 
issue of nuclear power, which is a problem that endangers the lives of the 
people and the country’s economy. If we can’t solve the problem, we have to 
abandon the nuclear power plant.” Naoto Kan also pointed out that over the past 
decade, nuclear power plants have produced only 3 percent of the total amount of 
electricity, while the construction costs of nuclear power plants have tripled, 
and the used fuel cannot be disposed of.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 21.25pt; line-height: 200%; layout-grid-mode: char; text-align:justify; margin-bottom:30px">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Ten years ago, He Zouxiu, Chinese Academy of 
Sciences academician, remarked: “Once a nuclear accident occurs, it is not only 
a matter of how many people die, but how many generations will be affected. The 
Chernobyl accident created an extensive no-man&#39;s land, and the Fukushima 
accident this year is unavoidable. Nuclear material will be active for thousands 
of years and will be a great burden to humanity.”</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The only way to overcome social anxiety is to 
have zero nuclear power.</span></p>
